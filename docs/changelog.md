## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-18
### Fixed
- **Misleading naming in SamplingEvaluation class**: Fixed inconsistent naming of the `_persist_intermediate_sample` and `_persist_final_sample` methods in the SamplingEvaluation class (incorrectly named as `_log_intermediate_sample` and `_log_final_sample`)
- **Mapped SRM model release** - added instructions for loading the [mapped SRM model checkpoints](https://github.com/spatialreasoners/spatialreasoners/releases/tag/v1.0.3)
- **MNIST classifier fix** - fixed a bug where the MNIST classifier was not being loaded correctly without an explicit `sr.set_cfg(cfg)` call, when using the `@sr.config_main` decorator.


## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-18
### Fixed
- **Intermediate sample visualization**: Fixed a bug with intermediate sample visualization not saving the intermediate samples**


## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-15
### Fixed
- **Config loading**: Fixed a bug where the base configs were not built into the package correctly

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-05
### Added
- **Variable normalization weights**: Added a registry entry to specify a normalization weights method -- including a trainable weighting method

### Fixed
- **Masked inference**: Fixed a bug where the inference caused by not updating the mask in sequentialized inference schedules, when some patches have already finished inference
- **Sudoku metric calculation errror**: Fixed the missing `_from_full_idx` method in the Sudoku variable mapper
